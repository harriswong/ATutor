A WikiWikiWeb allows its users to quickly and easy add or
change pages. Its best use is for collecting informations
to one very specific subject to build a powerful knowledge
base. But without contributors or editorial staff it won't
be a very useful tool.

For informations on how to contribute read the notes about
how to CreatePages and the summary of available WikiMarkup,
then try out the EditThisPage link on the bottom of the
every page.
