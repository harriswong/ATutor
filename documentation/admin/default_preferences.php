<h2>Default Preferences</h2>

<p>The default preferences are only applied to newly created accounts at the time of their creation and to guests when accessing public courses. Note that the default theme is set in the <a href="themes.php">Themes</a> area, and default language is set in the <a href="system_preferences.php">System Preferences</a> area.  Also, Auto-Login is not decided by administrators. Members may alter their settings once they have logged in by going to the Preferences area in the main navigation. For more information, see <a href="../general/preferences.php">Preferences</a> in the general help area.</p>
