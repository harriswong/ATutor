<h2>Adding/Editing Content</h2>
	<p>Content can be created in either 'plain text' or 'HTML' mode. Plain text mode is useful for quickly writing up text content. HTML mode allows for extra features like text formatting and layout, but is a little more complex to use.</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Title</dt>
		<dd><p>The main heading that will appear at the top of the page when viewed.</p></dd>		

		<dt>Customized Head</dt>
		<dd><p>HTML that normally appears in the <kbd>head</kbd> area of a Web page can be entered here. This can include things like links to stylesheets, or the actual stylesheet markup, or you may insert links to scripts, or the scripts themselves. Additional metadata can also be entered here. HTML content created in an external editor will have its head information displayed here when Pasting from a file (see below) after which you can upload the additional files like stylesheets or scripts, and adjust the links to point to the files in the course File Manager. Note that when importing eXe content, the stylesheet supplied with its content is replaced to avoid conflicts between eXe styles and ATutor styles.  </p></dd>

		<dt>Formatting: Plain Text</dt>
		<dd><p>If using plain text mode, just type the content in the Body window. Note that any extra spaces between characters will be removed (i.e. two or more spaces), but any blank lines will be saved with the text.</p></dd>

		<dt>Formatting: HTML</dt>
		<dd><p>If using HTML mode, you can type HTML tags in the Body window along with your text. If you are unfamiliar with HTML, you can use the visual editor by clicking the <code>Switch to visual editor</code> button.</p></dd>

		<dt>File Manager</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>The File Manager is a tool that allows you to upload files from your local system to be used in your course. The popup File Manager can be open alongside the Content Editor by selecting <kbd>Open File Manager</kbd>.</p>
			
			<p>See the <a href="file_manager.php">File Manager</a> section for details.</p>
		</dd>

		<dt>Terms</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>In either plain text or HTML formatting mode, you can insert <em>terms</em> to tell the ATutor system which words you wish to mark as glossary terms.</p>
			
			<p>Using the <em>Add Term</em> link will add <kbd>[?][/?]</kbd> into your content, and any text you put after <kbd>[?]</kbd> and before <kbd>[/?]</kbd> will specify the term you want to define. Alternatively, you can manually type <kbd>[?][/?]</kbd> into your text without having to use the <em>Add Term</em> link.</p>

			<p>Once you have specified the terms you would like to define, you can go to the <em>Glossary Terms</em> tab to write the definitions. Once this is done, the terms and their definitions will appear in the glossary and in the content.</p>
		</dd>

		<dt>Code</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>In either plain text or HTML formatting mode, you can insert <em>code</em> which is useful for differentiating blocks of text (like math equations, program code, or quotations) from the rest of the text content.</p>
			
			<p>Using the <em>Add Code</em> link will add <kbd>[code][/code]</kbd> into your content, and any text you put after <kbd>[code]</kbd> and before <kbd>[/code]</kbd> will specify the text you want to differentiate. Alternatively, you can manually type <kbd>[code][/code]</kbd> into your text without having to use the <em>Add Code</em> link.</p>
		</dd>

		<dt>Previous/Next</dt>
		<dd><p>Links can be generated by inserting the <kbd>[pid]</kbd> and the <kbd>[nid]</kbd> codes in your ATutor content.  When the page is displayed these codes get converted to the URL/Link for the previous or next pages in the sequence of content pages. For example <kdb><xmp><a href="[pid]">previous</a> <a href="[nid]">Next</a></xmp></kdb></p>

		<p>Or, pasted the [pid] and [nid] tags into the Link URL field in the visual editor.</p>
		</dd>

		<dt>Colours</dt>
		<dd><p>Like <em>code</em> and <em>terms</em>, colour may be added to text content in the same way. Use the appropriate colour icon to insert colour tags into the content. Valid colour options are blue, red, green, orange, purple, and gray. Also, colour codes can be typed in manually by using the following tags: <kbd>[blue][/blue]</kbd>, <kbd>[red][/red]</kbd>, <kbd>[green][/green]</kbd>, <kbd>[orange][/orange]</kbd>, <kbd>[purple][/purple]</kbd>, and <kbd>[gray][/gray]</kbd>.</p></dd>

		<dt>LaTeX</dt>
		<dd><p>Use <kbd>[tex][/tex]</kbd> to embed LaTeX equations into your content.</p></dd>

		<dt>Multimedia</dt>
		<dd><p>Use <kbd>[media][/media]</kbd> to embed multimedia into your content. Supported formats currently include: mpeg, mov, wmv, swf, mp3, wav, ogg, mid, and YouTube hosted videos. The media tag can take two parameters to define the width and height of the play when it displays <kbd>[media|640|480]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxcZ-dFffHA[/media]</kbd>. If the parameters are not defined, the player size will default to 425x350</p></dd>

		<dt>Paste from File</dt>
		<dd><p>Rather than typing out content, it can be uploaded from a text or HTML file on your local file system. Once uploaded, the content of that file will be displayed in the <em>Body</em> window. Keep in mind that uploading in this manner will replace any existing content in the <em>Body</em> window.</p></dd>

		<dt>Save and Close</dt>
		<dd><p>While editing or creating content, it is wise to frequently <kbd>Save</kbd> your content.  When you are finished, use <kbd>Close</kbd> to close the content editor.  Note that this does not save your content first so any unsaved content will be lost.</p></dd>
