<h2>2.4.3 Creating Themes</h2>
	<p>The process for creating a theme is basically to export an existing theme from ATutor, import it back into ATutor, then modify the source code of the copied theme. Details about creating themes can be found in the <a href="../../themes/themes_readme.txt"><kbd>themes_readme.txt</kbd></a> file found in the <kbd>/themes</kbd> directory of your ATutor installation. Also see the comments included in the files of the Default ATutor theme for additional details.</p>
