	<h2>Default Preferences</h2>

<p>Administrators are able to set the preferences for newly created members by specifying default preferences. Note that the default theme is set in the <a href="themes.php">Themes</a> area, and default language is set in the <a href="system_preferences.php">System Preferences</a> area.  Also, Auto-Login is not decided by administrators. Members can alter their settings once they have logged in by going to the Preferences area in the main navigation. For more information, see <a href="../general/preferences.php">Preferences</a> in the general help area.</p>
