<h2>2.4.1 Importing/Exporting Themes</h2>
	<p>Themes can be imported into, or exported from, ATutor using the Themes manager in the ATutor administrators' configuration tools. A theme might be downloaded from the atutor.ca Web site, or from another site, then imported into ATutor to give it a new look. Alternatively, a URL can be used to import the theme instead of having to download it first. An existing theme can be exported, then imported back into an ATutor installation to create a copy, after which the copy can be modified to create a new theme. Themes can be exported to share with others. See the <a href="http://www.atutor.ca/atutor/themes/index.php" target="_new">Themes page on atutor.ca</a> for a list of available themes, and for a place to share your themes.</p>
