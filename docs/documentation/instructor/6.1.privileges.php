<h2>6.1 Privileges</h2>

<p>Students who are enrolled in a course can be assigned course administrative privileges. This allows your students to perform actions like managing content, creating and marking tests, managing ACollab groups, or moderating forums or the chat. This tool is useful for creating teaching assistants, or for creating multiple instructors for a course.  Select the users you wish to give privileges to, and use the <em>Privileges</em> button.  Then choose which tools you want each student to have access to and use the <em>Save</em> button.</p>
