		<dt>Release Date</dt>
		<dd>The release date is the date when the content will be visible to students. A future release can be scheduled by specifying a later date. Specifying a release date that has past will release the content immediately. By default, the Release Date is set as the current date and time.</dd>
		
		<dt>Keywords</dt>
		<dd>Words entered into the Keywords area are given greater emphasis during searching. Therefore they will be placed higher in a list of search results than if there were no keywords. Keywords are also used as Learning Object Metadata when a content package is generated.</dd>
		
		<dt>Related Topics</dt>
		<dd><p>For each content page in the course, it is possible to specify other content pages as being related. Related topics can appear in the side menu, allowing students to quickly jump to a topic. Related topics are cross-refrenced meaning the content page chosen to be related will also be related to the current page.</p>
