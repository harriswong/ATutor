<h2>Syndicated Feeds</h2>
	<p>Since version 1.5.2, System Administrators are able to enter syndicated news feeds into the system, making them available to instructors to use in their courses. Instructors can display the news feeds in the side menu of their courses by going to <a href="side_menu.php">Side Menu</a> section of Student Tools, under Manage, and selecting a feed from the dropdowns.</p>
