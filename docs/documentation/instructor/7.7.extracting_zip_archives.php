<h2>7.7 Extracting Zip Archives</h2>
	<p>After uploading a ZIP file into the File Manager, select the <em>Extract Archive</em> icon next to the file name. This will display the contents of the zip file and suggest a directory name in which to unzip the archive. Use  the <code>Extract</code> button in the ZIP file viewer to unzip the file into the specified directory.</p>

	<p><strong>Illegal file types</strong> will not be extracted, and file names containing illegal characters will be renamed. The viewer will show illegal file types <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">crossed out</span>, and files with illegal characters pointing ( => ) to the renamed file that will be extracted.</p>
