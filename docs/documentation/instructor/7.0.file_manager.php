<h2>7. File Manager</h2>
	<p>ATutor has a file system used for storing course resource files, and it is managed with the <em>File Manager</em>. The File Manager allows instructors to include files associated with course content into content pages. The File Manager also allows you to create, edit, move, and delete files.</p>

	<p>The File Manager can be found in the <em>Manage</em> area, linked from the Content Editor so it can be opened while authoring content pages, or linked throughout the Test Question authoring screens so files can be managed while assembling tests.</p>
