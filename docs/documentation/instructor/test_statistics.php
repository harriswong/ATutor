<h2>Test Statistics</h2>

<p>To view a test's statistics, choose the test from the Test/Survey Manager and use the <code>Statistics</code> button.  There are two sets of statistics available for tests.  The first is <em>Question Statistics</em> which shows each question of the test and the number/percentage of students who chose each of the answers. <em>Submission Statistics</em> shows each submission's overall mark and marks given for each test question.  The overall test average is also calculated.</p>
