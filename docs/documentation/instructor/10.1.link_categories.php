<h2>10.1 Link Categories</h2>
	<p>It is necessary to create at least one category before adding any links. Use <em>Create Category</em> in the Links Manager to create categories for organising course links. To edit or delete existing categories use the <em>Categories</em> link in the Links Manager. Note that categories that have links associated with them may not be deleted until those links are removed from the category.</p>
