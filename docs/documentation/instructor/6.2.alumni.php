<h2>6.2 Alumni</h2>

<p>Instructors can designate students who have completed the course as alumni. This gives them access to all course content with the exception of tests and surveys. Alumi can particpate in activities to help new students master the content of the course. Select students from the <em>Enrolled</em> or <em>Un-enrolled</em> list,  then use <code>Mark Alumni</code> to add those students to the Alumni list.</p>
