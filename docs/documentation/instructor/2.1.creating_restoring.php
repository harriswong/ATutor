<h2>2.1 Creating &amp; Restoring Backups</h2>
	<p>To create a backup of the current course, use the <em>Create</em> link found on the Backups page. All created backups are stored securely on the ATutor server. The space required for the backups does not affect the course's size quota. Once a backup is created it will be listed on the main Backups page, where it can be managed.</p>

	<p>Backups can restored by selecting the backup and using the <kbd>Restore</kbd> button. The restoration process will presents details on what is stored in the backup and provides instructors with the ability to restore any or all of the available material.</p>
