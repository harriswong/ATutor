<h2>Accessibility</h2>
	<p>The Accessibility tab performs an analysis of the content for accessibility problems. Recommendations are given and you are given the option to implement or reverse corrections.</p>

	<p>After opening the Accessibility tab, review the report, and notice the number of <em>known</em> and <em>potential</em> problems</p>

	<p>Correct the known problems by reviewing the report, then returning to the Content tab to modify the HTML. Return to the Accessibility tab again when the known problems are corrected to see a <em>Conditional Pass</em>. Select from the choices available in the potential problems listed, then press <code>Make Decisions</code> to update the report. When all known problems are corrected, and decisions have been made on all potential problems, a <em>Full Pass</em> will be displayed, after which you can be sure the content will be accessible to all your students.</p>
